# Trivia Game

## Getting started

Start dev servers: `yarn dev`

## TODO

### UI

1.  Center start button, game over, etc.
2.  Countdown turns red/bold when 10 seconds remain
3.  Indicate correct answer (via animation?)
4.  Layout score, etc.

### UX

1.  Transfer questions into a stack, pop them off, if list is empty repopulate.
2.  Record high score
3.  Footer/header with link to high score, Github
4.  Show high scores in game over screen
5.  Rather than using findOne(), grab more 'random' entry.
6.  Figure out a way to catch 'cheaters' (ppl changing state)
7.  Timer continues when window in background.
